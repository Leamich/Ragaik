# Ragaik: A Math-Specific QA System Based on OCR

_Currently in development_

**Abstract**. This project aims to create a QA system based on a database of handwritten mathematical documents. It will include features for building a vectorized text database using OCR, and for deploying an on-demand server with an interface to interact with the QA system.

**Authors**: Michael Leontjev ([@Leamich](https:github.com/Leamich)), Konstantin Anisimov ([@TheKostins](https:github.com/TheKostins)), Sergey Shorohov ([@le9endwp]([url](https://github.com/le9endwp/))), Pavel Seroglazov (_TODO: url_).
